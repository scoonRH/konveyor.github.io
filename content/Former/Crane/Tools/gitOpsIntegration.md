All Crane commands are individual utilities, but when used together in sequence, they form a pipeline.

Crane makes it easy to integrate GitOps that apply the patches/resources generated at the end of the `apply` command on the destination cluster. The resources generated at the end of the process (i.e `export`, `transform`, `apply`) can be pushed to a GitHub repository, and a pipeline can be created to deploy the resources on a cluster on every push.
