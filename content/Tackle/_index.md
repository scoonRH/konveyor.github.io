Tackle is a collection of tools that support modernizing and migrating applications to Kubernetes. These tools assess applications to determine which option is the appropriate migration strategy for each application:
* Rehosting
* Replatforming
* Refactoring

Tackle uses an interactive questionnaire for the assessment which enables key stakeholders to gather information about applications, discuss risks flagged by Tackle, and reach a consensus in formulating recommendations for each application.

## Tackle Refactoring Tools
The tools are cloud-native micro-services that are accessible from a common [Tackle UI](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-ui/).
* Application Inventory
* Pathfinder
* Controls

### Application Inventory
[Tackle Application Inventory](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-application-inventory) is the vehicle which selects applications for assessment by Pathfinder. It provides users four  main functions:
* Maintain a portfolio of applications.
* Link applications to the business services they support.
* Define interdependencies.
* Add metadata using an extensible tagging model to describe and categorize applications in multiple dimensions.

### Pathfinder
[Tackle Pathfinder](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-pathfinder) is  an interactive questionnaire based tool that assesses the suitability of applications for modernization in order to deploy them into containers on an enterprise Kubernetes platform. The tool output includes::
* Application’s suitability for Kubernetes
* Associated risks
* Adoption plan with  the applications’ prioritization, business criticality and dependencies.

### Controls
[Tackle Controls](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-controls) are a collection of entities that add value to Application Inventory and the Pathfinder assessment. They comprise business services, stakeholders, stakeholder groups, job functions, tag types, and tags.
